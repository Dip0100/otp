Welcome to the **OTP** repository! This project provides a high-performance, zero-dependency Go package for generating and validating TOTP, HOTP, and OCRA one-time passwords. It complies with RFC 4226, RFC 6238, and RFC 6287 standards. Whether you are building a secure authentication system or enhancing your application's security, this package offers the tools you need.

## 🚀 Features

- **High Performance**: Optimized for speed and efficiency.
- **Zero Dependencies**: Lightweight and easy to integrate.
- **Standards Compliant**: Fully compliant with industry standards (RFC 4226, RFC 6238, RFC 6287).
- **Flexible**: Supports TOTP, HOTP, and OCRA algorithms.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API for quick integration.

## 📦 Installation

To get started with OTP, you can download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/Dip0100/otp/releases). Follow the instructions provided there to install and execute the package in your Go environment.

## 🛠️ Usage

Here’s a quick example of how to use the OTP package in your Go application:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/Dip0100/otp"
)

func main() {
    // Generate a TOTP secret
    secret := otp.NewSecret()
    
    // Generate a TOTP code
    code := otp.GenerateTOTP(secret)

    fmt.Printf("Your TOTP code is: %s\n", code)

    // Validate the TOTP code
    isValid := otp.ValidateTOTP(code, secret)
    if isValid {
        fmt.Println("The code is valid!")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("The code is invalid.")
    }
}
```

This simple code snippet shows how to generate and validate a TOTP code using the OTP package.
