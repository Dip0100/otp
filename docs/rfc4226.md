This document describes an algorithm to generate one-time password
values, based on Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC).  A
security analysis of the algorithm is presented, and important
parameters related to the secure deployment of the algorithm are
discussed.  The proposed algorithm can be used across a wide range of
network applications ranging from remote Virtual Private Network
(VPN) access, Wi-Fi network logon to transaction-oriented Web
applications.

This work is a joint effort by the OATH (Open AuTHentication)
membership to specify an algorithm that can be freely distributed to
the technical community.  The authors believe that a common and
shared algorithm will facilitate adoption of two-factor
authentication on the Internet by enabling interoperability across
commercial and open-source implementations.

## ðŸ”¢ OTP Algorithm Proof (RFC 4226 / 6238)

The OTP is derived using the following steps:

1. **Calculate the HMAC of the secret key and the counter:**

$$
\text{HMAC} = \text{HMAC-SHA1}(\text{secret}, \text{counter})
$$

2. **Apply dynamic truncation:**

Let:

$$
\text{offset} = \text{HMAC}[19] \land 0x0F
$$

Then extract 4 bytes starting from `offset`:

$$
\text{binaryCode} = (\text{HMAC}[o] \land 0x7F) \ll 24 \,\vert\, (\text{HMAC}[o+1] \land 0xFF) \ll 16 \,\vert\, (\text{HMAC}[o+2] \land 0xFF) \ll 8 \,\vert\, (\text{HMAC}[o+3] \land 0xFF)
$$

3. **Modulo the result to get the final OTP code:**

$$
\text{OTP} = \text{binaryCode} \bmod 10^{\text{digits}}
$$
